# Coursera-Class
### This repository is about the Coursera courses that I have taken.

This repository also contains all the files that I used during the courses I took on the Coursera platform.

I decided to create this repository to store all my files in one place for easy access and management. These files include assignments, exercises, and projects that I worked on during the courses.

I hope this repository can help me develop my skills and also assist others who want to learn the same topics. This repository is open to the public, so please use the files here wisely and in accordance with the course requirements.
